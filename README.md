Cleaning Nashville Housing dataset on SQLite

I *mostly* followed along with an Alex the Analyst video about cleaning a dataset using SQL.  I have been practicing in different SQL programs.  In this project I chose SQLite which was challenging in a lot of ways.   There were some queries he used that SQLite does not support.  It did give me the opportunity research and practice new skills.   I felt my confidence growing during this practice.
